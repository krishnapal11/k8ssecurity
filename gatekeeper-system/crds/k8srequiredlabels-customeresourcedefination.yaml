                      ExcludedNamespaces is a list of namespace names. If defined, a
                      constraint only applies to resources not in a listed namespace.
                      ExcludedNamespaces also supports a prefix or suffix based glob.  For example,
                      `excludedNamespaces: [kube-*]` matches both `kube-system` and
                      `kube-public`, and `excludedNamespaces: [*-system]` matches both `kube-system` and
